// Logical Operators

// Task 11:  && (AND) operator  (in this case all conditions should be true)
let cAnd = 10 > 8 && 10 < 12;
console.log(cAnd); // both are ture


// Task 12: || (OR) operator  (in this case any one condition should be true)
let cOR = 10 > 8 || 10 > 12;

// Task 13: ! (NOT) operator (Opposite of Conditons)

let cNot = !(10 > 9);
